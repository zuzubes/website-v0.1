      When I started living on my own as a graduate student in 2015, I had to learn how to cook, clean, and do laundry. I was lucky enough to have a dishwasher, but I never used it. I found that I actually enjoyed washing dishes by hand.

      The first benefit is that of course the work is being done. But there's another benefit: doing the dishes is a form of meditation for me.

      The first step of a zen practice is to focus on breathing. As you breathe, you notice your thoughts, but you don't engage with them. You just let them float by. I've found that doing the dishes is a perfect time to practice this.

      There are so many sensations to focus on: the warm water on my hands, the soap bubbles, the texture of the sponge, the sound of the water. It's a full sensory experience that helps me stay present.

      ## It's a great way to start off my day

      When I wake up, I usually have a few dishes from the night before. I make myself a cup of coffee, and then I do the dishes. It's a nice way to ease into the day.

      The dishes are always there, waiting for me. They're a constant in my life, a reminder that there are simple tasks that need to be done, and that I can do them.

      ## It helps me "reset" (bonus: cleaner kitchen!)

      One of the unexpected benefits of doing the dishes is that it helps me reset my mental space. If I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed, I can go to the kitchen and do the dishes. It's a simple task that I can complete, and it gives me a sense of accomplishment.

      Plus, a clean kitchen is just generally a nicer to work in. It's a lot easier to cook when you have clean dishes and a clean counter.

      ## Your family and friends will LOVE you!

      If you live with your spouse, family, or roommates, doing the dishes is a great way to contribute to the household. It's a simple task that makes a big difference.

      Even if you don't live with others, having a clean kitchen when friends come over is always appreciated. It's one less thing to worry about when you're hosting.

      So next time you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, try doing the dishes. It might just be the reset you need.
